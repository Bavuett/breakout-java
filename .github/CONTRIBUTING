The Source Code is located inside the "src" directory, since this is the default in VS Code. <br>
For the same reason, the Java Bytecode files (ending in .class) are located in the "bin" directory.

You may use the "JPackage Command.bat" file located in the "utilities" directory to generate a new
Installer in case you make a new release. Remember to edit it to use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/),
and to fit your development environment (directories etc).
