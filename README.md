## What is this?

Breakout-Java is a clone of the original Breakout, made by Steve Wozniak, Nolan Bushnell and Steve Bristow while working in Atari in 1976. 

This is a fan-recreation which was assigned by my Computer Science teacher to teach us how to develop Graphical User Interfaces using Java's AWT and Swing libraries in the most fun way possible.
