# Breakout in Java.
### Created  by Lorenzo Barretta (@DevLBD).

Breakout-Java is a school project gave by my IT teacher to learn how to develop Graphical User Interfaces while having fun.

I loved developing it and, for this reason, I decided to upload it on GitHub to keep a copy.

Also, GitHub makes it easy to have the same copy of your work in several machines and, since I'll have to get this graded sometime in the future, it's a win-win situation.
