# Breakout in Java.
Clone of the original Breakout (1976) made by [Lorenzo Barretta](https://devlbd.xyz).

## What is this?

Breakout-Java is a clone of the original Breakout, made by Steve Wozniak, Nolan Bushnell and Steve Bristow while working in Atari in 1976. 

This is a fan-recreation which was assigned by my Computer Science teacher to teach us how to develop Graphical User Interfaces using Java's AWT and Swing libraries in the most fun way possible.

## Requirements.

There are no requirements if you Install the app using the ``` .msi ``` file since it contains everything you need to get started. 

However, if you'd like to run the project on your machine without any installation, you need Java 17 or greater. \
You can verify which version of Java you are using by typing ``` java -version ``` on your OS's command line shell.

Here is the [Java 17's download page](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html), in case you need it.

## Installation.

All the files you need to Install and Run the app on your Windows machine are available below. 

In case you do not use Windows, you may compile an Installer for your machine using [jpackage](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/14/docs/specs/man/jpackage.html), or run the project without making an Installer. Instructions are available on the download page.

If you are on Windows, another easy way to install the game is through the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/it-it/p/bricks-crusher-break-the-bricks/).
